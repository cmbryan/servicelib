It is right in -- deed 
 we should mag -- ni -- fy the one who grants life, 
 you, that stretched your hands wide upon the Cross, 
 broke and smashed the might and power of the foe.
 
 It is right in -- deed 
 you to mag -- ni -- fy, who fash -- ion all thing -- s, 
 your pains from cor -- rup -- tion de -- liv -- er us, 
 and your Pas -- sion grants dis -- pas -- sion to our souls. 
 
 
 All Earth quaked in fear 
 and the sun con -- cealed it -- self, O Sa -- viour, 
 when, O Christ, our light, you set bod -- ily, 
 as the light that knows no even -- ing was en -- tombed. 
 
 
 Sleep -- ing in the tomb 
 with the sleep that breathes forth life, Anoin -- ted, 
 from sin's heavy sleep you, as God, aroused 
 all the hu -- man race that sin had held en -- thralled. 
 
 
 "Of all wo -- man- -- kind 
 I alone bore you, my child, without pain; 
 cruel pangs now wrack me as I be -- hold 
 your great suf -- fer -- ing", the Holy Vir -- gin cries. 
 
 
 See -- ing you on high, 
 nev -- er sep -- ar -- ated from the Father, 
 yet be -- low on Earth, laid out as a corpse,
 the dread Ser -- aph -- im, my Sa -- viour, shake with fear. 
 
 
 
 See, the Temple Veil,
 rent asun -- der at your cru -- ci -- fix -- ion, 
 Heav -- en's beacons hide, O my Christ, their light, 
 to see you, the Sun, now hid be -- neath the earth. 
 
 
 He who at the start 
 by His will alone set Earth re -- volving, 
 life -- less as a mor -- tal sets un -- der earth; 
 let the sky now shake and tremble at the sight. 
 
 
 Hu -- man- -- kind you formed, 
 with your own hand fash -- ioned us, O Sa -- viour, 
 now, O Sun, you set un -- der -- neath the earth, 
 rais -- ing com -- pan -- ies of mor -- tals from the fall. 
 
 
 Come, now, let us sing, 
 let our sac -- red hymn lament the dead Christ, 
 singing as the Myrrh- -- bear -- ing wo -- men did, 
 that with them we too may hear the word "re -- joice!" 
 
 
 Truly you are Myrrh, 
 truly, Word of God, the Myrrh Un -- fail -- ing, 
 so it was myrrh- -- bear -- ers brought myrrh to you, 
 to the Liv -- ing God brought myrrh as to the dead. 
 
 
 Bur -- ied, O my Christ, 
 the great palaces of Hell you shattered, 
 Death you put to death by your death, O Lord, 
 from cor -- rup -- tion you set free those born of earth. 
 
 
 
 To the grave des -- cends 
 he, the Wis -- dom of our God, that pours out 
 streams of life; des -- cend -- ing in -- to a tomb, 
 giv -- ing life to those in Hades deep -- est depth -- s. 
 
 
 "Will -- ingly by death 
 I was wounded in the flesh, dear Mother, 
 thus the broken nature of mor -- tal kind 
 to re -- new, so do not beat your breast in grief." 
 
 
 When be -- neath the Earth 
 you had set, the Morn -- ing Star of justice, 
 you aroused the dead as if they but slept, 
 as you put to flight the murk and gloom of Hell. 
 
 
 Sown with tears today, 
 the life-breath -- ing grain of two- -- fold nature, 
 here with -- in earth's fur -- rows the grain is sown, 
 but to -- mor -- row it will burst once more to life. 
 
 
 Trem -- bling, Adam quailed, 
 when God walked in Para -- dis -- e, he feared him, 
 but re -- joices now as God enters Hell. 
 As of old he fell, so now he rises up. 
 
 
 Of -- fer -- ings of tears, 
 O my Christ, your Moth -- er poured out, weep -- ing, 
 as in flesh you lay bur -- ied in the grave, 
 "But arise, my Son, as you fore -- told", she cried. 
 
 
 
 Filled with godly fear, 
 in a new tomb noble Joseph hides 
 you, singing, Sa -- viour, hymns for your buri -- al, 
 hymns be -- fit -- ting God and mingled with la -- ment -- s. 
 
 
 Bolts of bit -- ter grief 
 pierced you Mother -- 's soul, and nails of an -- guish, 
 when she saw you nailed to a Tree, O Word, 
 saw you fastened to the Cross with cruel nails. 
 
 
 When her eyes be -- held 
 you who are the whole world's sweet -- ness, 
 drink -- ing, O my Sa -- viour, the bit -- ter drink, 
 your sweet Moth -- er drenched her eyes with bit -- ter tears. 
 
 
 "Dread -- ful is the wound, 
 all my in -- ward parts are rent asun -- der, 
 as your un -- just slaughter I see, O Word", 
 cried the Vir -- gin most af -- flic -- ted as she wept.
 
 
 "Tell me, Word of God, 
 how am I to close you lips and sweet eye -- s,
 how to bury you as be -- fits the dead?" 
 cried the noble Joseph, shiv -- er -- ing with fear. 
 
  
 Sac -- red hymns they sing, 
 Nicodemus and the noble Joseph, 
 while the Ser -- aph -- im join them in their hymn 
 for the buri -- al of Christ, who now lies dead. 
 
 
 
 Sun of justice, now 
 you have set be -- neath the earth, my Sa -- viour 
 There -- fore she, the Moon that gave birth to you, 
 is ec -- lipsed with grief, at see -- ing you no more. 
 
 
 Hades trembled then, 
 when he saw you, the Life- -- giv -- ing Sa -- viour, 
 in your might de -- spoil -- ing him of his wealth, 
 rais -- ing up the dead he held from every age. 
 
 
 Once the night has passed 
 then again, O Word, the bright Sun blazes; 
 ra -- di -- ant you blaze forth, when after death, 
 as though from a bridal cham -- ber, you arise. 
 
  
 How Earth quaked with fear, 
 O Cre -- at -- or, as in -- to her bos -- om, 
 shak -- ing, she re -- ceived you, my Sav -- ing Lord, 
 by her fear -- ful shak -- ing she awoke the dead. 
 
 
 With sweet myrrh, O Christ, 
 Nicodemus and the noble Joseph 
 laid you out for buri -- al strange and new, 
 as they cried aloud, "Now tremble, all the earth!" 
 
 
 Maker of the light, 
 you have set, and with you sets the sun -- light; 
 all cre -- ation, trem -- bling and shud -- der -- ing, 
 now pro -- claims you as the Maker all thing -- s. 
 
 
 
 Christ, our Corner -- stone, 
 Him a stone hewn from the rock now cov -- er -- s; 
 Tremble Earth to see how a mor -- tal man 
 hides away our God as mor -- tal in a tomb! 
 
  
 "O my Child, be -- hold 
 the dis -- ciple whom you loved; my sweet one, 
 see your Moth -- er too, and grant us a word", 
 cried the Vir -- gin as she raised her sad lament. 
 
  
 O, Life- -- giv -- ing Word, 
 even stretched out on the Cross and nailed there, 
 you, as Lord of Life, did not kill the Jew -- s, 
 grant -- ing re -- sur -- rec -- tion even to their dead. 
 
  
 Suf -- fer -- ing, O Word, 
 you were quite bereft of form and beau -- ty; 
 Rising, Lord, you shone forth resplen -- dently, 
 and with your God -- head's rays made mor -- tals fair. 
 
  
 In the flesh you set, 
 â€˜neath the earth, Dawn Star that knows no even -- ing, 
 at height of noon-day the sun grew dark, 
 as un -- able to en -- dure the fear -- ful sight. 
 
  
 Sun and moon grew dark, 
 they are im -- ages of faith -- ful ser -- vant -- s, 
 who, as mourn -- er -- s, Sa -- viour, at -- tire them -- selves 
 in the sombre mourn -- er -- s' robes of deep -- est black. 
 
 
  
 "Though you hung there dead, 
 the cen -- tur -- i -- on knew you as true God. 
 See, with fear I shake", noble Joseph cried, 
 "Tell me, how am I to touch you with my hand -- s?" 
 
  
 Adam lay asleep, 
 an -- d, while sleep -- ing, from his side brought forth death. 
 You, O Word of God, who are sleep -- ing here, 
 now are pour -- ing from your side life for the world. 
 
  
 For a while you slept, 
 to the dead who lay in Hell you brought life. 
 Rising up, O Good One, you then raised up 
 all the mul -- ti -- tudes of dead from every age. 
 
 
 Vine from which life flows! 
 As above the earth, Lord, you were lif -- ted, 
 you poured forth the wine of sal -- va -- tion then, 
 now I glor -- i -- fy your Pas -- sion and your Cross. 
 
  
 Lords of An -- gel Host -- s, 
 when they saw you, O my Sa -- viour, na -- ked, 
 blood-s -- tained, and con -- demned, how did they en -- dure 
 to per -- ceive your cru -- ci -- fier -- s' in -- solence? 
 
 
 What per -- versity! 
 Come, most crooked race of Hebrews, tell us, 
 how could you con -- demn the Anoin -- ted One, 
 when you knew the temple would be raised again. 
 
 
  
 In a mock -- ing cloak 
 you have clothed the one who or -- ders all thing -- s. 
 He ar -- rayed the Earth, and most won -- drously, 
 he it was who strewed the stars across the skies. 
 
  
 Like the pel -- ic -- an, 
 you gave life, O Word, to your dead chil -- dren, 
 wounded in your side, you let life-blood flow, 
 let -- ting fall life- -- giv -- ing drops of blood on all. 
 
  
 Je -- sus stayed the sun, 
 as of old he smote the for -- eign foe, Lord; 
 you, Christ, hid its light as you over -- threw 
 that great prince, the Lord of dark -- ness and of death. 
 
  
 O Com -- pas -- sion -- ate, 
 while re -- main -- ing in your Father -- 's bos -- om, 
 mor -- tal nature will -- ingly you as -- sumed, 
 and as mor -- tal man, O Christ, went down to Hell. 
 
 
 He who hung the earth 
 on the wa -- ter -- s, on a Cross is lif -- ted, 
 as a life -- less corpse he is laid in earth, 
 which, un -- able to en -- dure it, dreads and quakes. 
 
 
 "Woe is me, my Son! 
 For I hoped as king to see you reign -- ing, 
 whom I see con -- demned, hanging on the Cross," 
 the pure Vir -- gin Moth -- er voices her lament. 
 
 
 
 "G -- ab -- ri -- el an -- nounced, 
 in the won -- drous mes -- sage that he brought me, 
 the etern -- al king -- dom he said would be 
 the pos -- ses -- sion of my Je -- sus, my dear Son". 
 
 
 "Woe, alas for me! 
 Now a proph -- ecy has found ful -- fil -- ment, 
 As the just man Sy -- meon had fore -- told, 
 now, Em -- manuel, your sword has pierced my heart." 
 
 
 Are you not ashamed? 
 Tell me, do not all those dead he raised up 
 shame you, for the Giver of life is he, 
 whom from spite -- ful envy, Jew -- s, you did to death. 
 
 
 Bit -- terly she wept, 
 your all-blame -- less Mother, when she saw you 
 ly -- ing dead, O Word, ly -- ing in the tomb, 
 the etern -- al God no lan -- guage can ex -- press. 
 
 
 See -- ing you, my Christ, 
 you, the Light in -- vis -- ible, now hid -- den, 
 life -- less in the grave, then the sun on high 
 shook and trembled as its light grew dark in fear. 
 
 
 When she saw your death 
 then your Moth -- er free from all de -- file -- ment 
 cried out, O my Christ, bit -- terly to you, 
 "Life, I beg, do not delay among the dead!" 
 
 
 
 Hades, death's dread lord, 
 shook in fear, he shuddered when he saw you, 
 Sun of glory, death -- less and ra -- di -- ant, 
 and he gave up all his pris -- on -- ers in haste. 
 
 
 Ter -- rible in -- deed, 
 great the sight that now is seen, O Sa -- viour, 
 He, the cause of life, will -- ing went to death, 
 wish -- ing life to bring as gift to all man -- kind. 
 
 
 Lord, your side was pierced, 
 nails were hammered through your hand -- s, O Sa -- viour, 
 from your side came heal -- ing to heal the wound, 
 and to cure the greed of our first par -- ent -- s' hand -- s. 
 
 
 Once for Rachel's son 
 house by house were all set sadly weep -- ing. 
 With his Moth -- er now, the Dis -- ciples' choir 
 in its grief mourns and la -- ments the Vir -- gin's Son. 
 
 
 With their hands they gave 
 a great blow upon the cheek of Je -- sus, 
 Christ, who with his hand fash -- ioned all man -- kind 
 Christ, who with his hand has crushed the Beast's foul fang -- s. 
 
 
 With our hymns, O Christ, 
 all the faith -- ful bring their ad -- or -- a -- tion, 
 to your cru -- ci -- fix -- ion and buri -- al; 
 by your buri -- al we have been freed from death.
 
 Great etern -- al God, 
 co-eternal Word and Holy Spir -- it, 
 look down in your good -- ness on those who rule, 
 grant their sceptres strength against the war -- like foe. 
 
 Wholly un -- defiled, 
 Mother, who gave birth to life, pure Vir -- gin, 
 end all scan -- dals which still be -- set Church, 
 and as you are lov -- ing, Mother, grant her peace.
 
 It is right in -- deed 
 we should mag -- ni -- fy the one who grants life, 
 you, that stretched your hands wide upon the Cross, 
 broke and smashed the might and power of the foe.
